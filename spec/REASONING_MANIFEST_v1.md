# Reasoning Manifest v1.0 — Specification

The Kid Cosmo Reasoning Manifest is the standard for documenting autonomous system deliberation in the Exclusion Zone. It transforms a standard sensor log into a **Decision Trajectory**.

## Field Definitions

### `is_dark_window`
A mandatory boolean representing whether the agent is operating in an intended state of epistemic isolation.

### `agent_reasoning`
The core cognitive output. This block is typically generated by a local, physics-grounded LLM (e.g., Qwen 2.5 7B) during simulation or real-world inference.

### `trajectory_context`
Ensures every decision is cryptographically tied to its parent physics data. Eliminates the need for manual data joins in ML training pipelines.

### `sha256_proof`
The hash of the manifest (pre-proof) to ensure data integrity during export and verification.
